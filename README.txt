+ This is my home-made OS based on the book '30 Days of Home-made Operating Systems'(author by Hidemi Kawai).

+ I follow the source of the book, and make some changes according to my own interests. I make it only for learning Operating Systems, not for
  business. And I will change the core codes that the book provides.

  line.
